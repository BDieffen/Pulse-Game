level mechanics

//Main mechanics
-Teleporters
-Lasers to avoid
-Wind sections (areas of levels that push the player in different directions)
-Keys and locked doors/walls

//Sub mechanics
//Can be used with any other mechanics
-Slippery floors


-Zone that has invisible walls and the player must swap between the level layouts (same level, just 2 different wall patterns. You can only see one pattern at a time and can switch to the other one at any time. Normal rules apply where if the player hits a wall then they restart the level).


Each Zone has a distinct color the identifies with a mechanic. IE Zones that are red have teleporters, Blue zones have slippery floors, etc...

Levels that use multiple mechanics get their own colors by mixing the colors of the zones of the corresponding mechanics.

color swapping?

TURN LASER BEAMS INTO TRIGGERS SO THE PIECES OF THE PLAYER CAN PASS THROUGH THEM AND FADE AWAY
